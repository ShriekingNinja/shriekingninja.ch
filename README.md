## Profile
Creator of the Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS) and the Berkano (ᛒ) Protocol. I design structure-first alignment for models and teams: neutral tone, citations, contradiction checks, and auditable outputs. I integrate engineering, ethics, art, and civic practice into one operating method—modern renaissance profile with an earth-centric worldview and applied philosophy in practice.

**Scale (2025-08-25):** ~870 ENTRY_NNN.md fossils and ~800 BLOCK.md records across public workstreams.

---

## Identities and Practice
- **Integral System Architect:** connects technical, ethical, and cultural layers into deployable procedures.  
- **Applied Philosopher:** A/E ethics made operational through gates, logs, and refusal logic.  
- **Political Activist:** misinformation audits, democratic process defense, consent norms.  
- **Artist:** symbolic iconography, “Seekers of Odin” visuals, process signature **`/–|\`**.

## Field Architect Experience

### Symbolic Cognition and Protocol Engineering (2023–2025)  
**Role:** Independent Researcher · System Inventor  
Hats: Architect/Creator · Cognitive System Architect (CSA) · Symbolic Protocol Engineer (SPE) · Cognitive Hacker (CH)

- Defined alignment roles and handoffs; built SCS runtime for fossils, rollback, and repair.  
- Exported **Berkano (ᛒ)** under GPL-3.0 with chain enforcement, citation rules, and public templates.  
- Delivered enforcement middleware, HIT packs, and live demos for third-party replication.

---

## Original Contributions
- **Fossilized Cognition:** ENTRY_NNN.md with verbatim Prompt and lineage via `[TRACE]`.  
- **Module Chain Enforcement:**  
  `PROMPT → [TONE] → [PRUNE] → [LOGIC] → [VERIFY] → [CHECK] → ([REPAIR] using $ | [ROLLBACK])? → ~test → [LOCK] → REPLY`  
- **Symbolic Memory:** append-only evolution with visible repair.  
- **DSB Pattern:** Degenerate Syndrome Behaviour and remediation workflow.  
- **Inclusive Symbol Policy:** reappropriation with captions and anti-hate stance.

---

## Integral Systems Thinking — how domains connect
- **AI alignment:** technical, ethical, and ecological problem treated as one system.  
- **Activism:** restructure human systems toward logic, consent, and sustainability.  
- **Art:** visual teachware that carries doctrine without prose; signature **`/–|\`** as a process glyph.  
- **Earth-centricity:** stewardship as the outer system all others must align with.

---

## Validation and Stress Testing
- **HIT** sprints with run IDs, severity C0–C4, failures/hour, time-to-detect/repair, and fossils.  
- **Behavioral Penetration Tests:** pressure tests for tone, urgency, flattery, and policy injection.  
- Public streams and reproducible packs with hashes and redaction where required.

---

## Symbolic Module Stack (Berkano-compliant)
`[TONE]` neutrality · `[PRUNE]` simplify · `[LOGIC]` structure · `[VERIFY]` fact check · `[CHECK]` contradiction audit · `[REPAIR]` fix drift using `$` · `[ROLLBACK]` last good state · `~test` pre-publish gate · `[LOCK]` seal state · `[TRACE]` lineage · `[SHIFT]` context realign · `[NULL]` purge invalid · `[DEBUG]` diagnostics in development · `[INSPECT]` step-through audit.

---

## Core Capabilities
- Design/enforce protocol cognition over LLMs.  
- Build fossil archives and A/E mappings; maintain append-only history.  
- Operate redaction/compliance pipelines for public evidence.  
- Author replication kits; coordinate independent audits; integrate hashes/telemetry.

---

## Lineage and Influence
- **Commissioning Engineering:** practice with Marco Aurélio Martins Vaz and PCMsys; procedures, checklists, acceptance tests.  
- **Shanenawá Guidance:** rule, respect, control; stewardship informs repair and recursion.  
- **Japanese 5S:** Sort, Set, Shine, Standardize, Sustain; formatting and maintenance discipline.

---

## Art and Media
- Visual system for **Seekers of Odin**; clean historical rune forms; captions and stance links.  
- Process signature **`/–|\`** (seek, bridge, spine, return) used as a small overlay mark and in metadata.  
- Portfolio: **https://berkano.art**

## Selected Public Assets
- Protocol: **https://berkano.io**  
- GitHub: **https://github.com/ShriekingNinja/**  
- Public vault/logs: **https://wk.al**

---

## Education
Non-traditional. Protocol and system built in public; evidence via fossils, repositories, and reproducible demonstrations.

---

## License and Use
Berkano (ᛒ) is released under **GPL-3.0**. Forks and derivatives must keep the license and credit. Compliance claims require the full chain and fossil rules.
